The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It was named after Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Standing at a height of 324 meters (1,063 feet), it is the tallest structure in Paris and one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world. The tower was constructed in 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair and has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world. Visitors can enjoy the stunning panoramic views of Paris from the top of the tower, accessible by elevator or stairs.
